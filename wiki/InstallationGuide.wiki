#summary Installation hints.
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Prerequisites =

You need [http://code.google.com/p/fuserl fuserl] and [http://code.google.com/p/fragmentron fragmentron].

You also need [http://support.process-one.net/doc/display/CONTRIBS/EUnit eunit] from process one.

= Installing =

The project uses automake.  The default prefix is /usr; if you don't like that, use the {{{--prefix}}} option to configure.

Running {{{make check}}} is strongly suggested.

= Hello World =

No nice mkfs util or anything right now ...

You should now have a walkenfs mounted at {{{/tmp/walken}}}.  Try stuff, see what happens. [[#1 1]] If you exit the Erlang shell it will get unmounted.  (There will also now be an directory named {{{Mnesia.XXXX@YYYY}}}, where XXXX is your process id and YYYY is your hostname, that contains the actual filesystem data).

= Tested Platforms =

  * Ubuntu 64 bit Linux (feisty).
  * OS/X 10.4 i386: known *not* to work, I'm trying to figure it out.

= Footnotes =

== 1 ==

Try things *outside* the Erlang emulator.  Otherwise you will find it very easy to deadlock the file server.  Not sure why this happens yet.  In our production systems we run walkenfs in a separate Erlang emulator and always will (Erlang being an "implementation detail").
